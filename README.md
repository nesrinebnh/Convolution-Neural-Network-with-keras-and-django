Pneumonia is an infection induced by diverse organisms. The seriousness of the disease depends on multiple factors; some are Clinical symptoms like fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath. Others are related to the patient background; we can cite a weakened immune system. Doctors diagnose pneumonia by combining the results of clinical examination with the outcomes of the x-ray chest that should reveal areas of opacity. Our aim in this project is to create an application that uses an AI model, which takes an x-ray chest and classify it whether it concerns pneumonia or not.
