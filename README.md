## :writing_hand: Description

Pneumonia is an infection induced by diverse organisms. The seriousness of the disease depends on multiple factors:
* Clinical symptoms like fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath. 
* Patient background like a weakened immune system. 

Doctors diagnose pneumonia by combining the results of clinical examination with the outcomes of the x-ray chest that should reveal areas of opacity. Our aim in this project is to create an application that uses an AI model, which takes an x-ray chest and classify it whether it concerns pneumonia or not. To do so, we will:
1. first download our dataset, and preprocess it. 
2. Then, implement several architectures. 
3. Finally, we will choose the best according to metrics.
